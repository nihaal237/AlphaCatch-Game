## ⚙️ Project Overview

- 🖥️ **Platform:** 8088 Assembly (x86 Architecture)
- 🕹️ **Type:** Text-based arcade-style game
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Interaction:** Achieved through interrupt handling and timer control
- 📦 **Memory Manipulation:** Directly interfaced with hardware and video memory

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Falling random alphabets rendered in the console window
- User-controlled catcher (e.g., using arrow keys)
- Real-time catching logic with score tracking
- Game-over condition and restart mechanism
- Smooth gameplay using **BIOS interrupts** and **custom delay loops**

---

## 🧠 Learning Highlights

- Working with **8088 instruction set**
- Handling **keyboard input via interrupts**
- Writing to **video memory** (e.g., segment `0xB800`)
- Structuring a game loop in a low-level environment
- Efficient use of **registers**, **stack**, and **procedures**

earning purposes as part of low-level programming coursework.
